## How to access the Firmware Settings

To access the firmware settings, the Scoppy app must have established a connection to the Scoppy firmware on the Pico (W) (ie. the connection badge at the lower left of the app screen should show a status of _OK_). For help with this see [Getting started with Scoppy and the Pico W](../wiki/Getting-started-with-the-Pico-W).

Tap the connection badge at the the lower left of the screen and then tap _Connected device_ and then _Firmware settings_.
