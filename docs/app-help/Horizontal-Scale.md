title: Horizontal Scale
---

There are a number ways that the horizontal scale (Time/div) can be adjusted.

### 1. Slider
Tap the Time/div value that is displayed at the top of the screen. The Time/div setting can be adjusted by moving the slider. This is a good method
for finding the signal if the frequency is not known or for coarse adjustment of the setting. When looking for a signal of unknown frequency, move the
slider fairly slowly so that Scoppy can update the sampling rate as the timebase changes.

> TIP: When looking for a signal of unknown frequency, start at the shortest timebase setting (ie. start from the left) to reduce the chance of seeing
aliased versions of the signal.
